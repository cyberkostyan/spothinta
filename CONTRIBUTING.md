## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (not npm or yarn)

### Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spothinta.git
cd spothinta

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Lint code
pnpm lint

# Build to check for errors
pnpm build
```

## Code Style

### General Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code patterns and structure
- Keep components small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### File Naming

- React components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Utilities and hooks: `camelCase.ts`
- Pages follow Next.js conventions

### TypeScript

- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Export types when they may be reused

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use shadcn/ui components when possible
- Maintain dark mode compatibility

### Internationalization

- All user-facing text must be in translation files
- Add translations for both `en.json` and `fi.json`
- Use `useTranslations` hook from `next-intl`

## Commit Guidelines

Write clear, concise commit messages:

```
Add price alert notification sound

- Add audio file for notifications
- Implement sound toggle in settings
- Update translations
```

**Format:**
- First line: imperative mood, max 50 characters
- Blank line after first line (if adding details)
- Additional details in bullet points

**Good examples:**
- `Fix chart rendering on mobile devices`
- `Add temperature overlay to price chart`
- `Update Finnish translations for settings page`

**Avoid:**
- `Fixed stuff`
- `WIP`
- `Changes`

## Pull Request Process

   - What the PR does
   - Why the change is needed
   - How to test it
   - Screenshots for UI changes
